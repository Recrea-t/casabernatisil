    and there is a wide selection of local artisan products at your disposal. 


    We offer two types of breakfasts, sweet and savoury. 


    1. Sweet breakfast: country bread, homemade jam, homemade cake or muffins, homemade yogurt, homemade mixture of dried fruits, seasonal fruit, organic juices, milk, coffee and tea.

    2. Savoury: country bread, tomatoes, organic juices, eggs from our hens, traditional cold cuts and cheeses from Pallars (for example, xolís and bull), coffee and tea.


    We seek to offer products made by us or by artisans and producers of the region.\
