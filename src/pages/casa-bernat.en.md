    Hem aïllat tèrmicament totes les parets exteriors de la casa amb llana de
    roca, evitant els derivats del petroli.


    En tota la casa predomina la fusta i la pedra.


    La calefacció i l’aigua calenta sanitària s’alimenten d’energia renovable, amb estella procedent del Pallars.


    Disposem d'un endoll per recàrrega de vehicle elèctric per als clients.

    Jaume and Núria will welcome you to Casa Bernat. We are a young couple who
    want to help you discover Pallars Sobirà and Valls d'Àneu and have a
    memorable stay at Casa Bernat.


    Jaume is a canyon guide, ski instructor, half-mountain guide and volunteer firefighter.


    Núria is a geologist, ski instructor and guide at Casa de l'Os Bru in the Pyrenees.


    We were both born in Vallès Occidental and decided to leave the city to start our life project in Pallars.


    In addition to Casa Bernat, we manage [SnowCanyonPallars](http://www.snowcanyonpallars.com/), our small company of adventure sports and nature activities. For all ages and levels, we offer ski lessons, snowshoeing trips, canyoning, excursions, via ferrata, guide services and interpretative outings
history:
  title: A bit of history of the house
  description: >
    Casa Bernat is a 'big house' in the village of Isil. A house with many
    centuries of history. In fact, we do not know its origin. The earliest
    reference found are documents from the sixteenth century referring to the
    purchase of livestock by Jaume Barado from Casa Bernat d'Isil.

    Its plastered façade indicates it was a prosperous household. At the end of
    the eighteenth century the house already had a stone oven, stables and a
    hayloft.


    In 2018 we acquired the house from the heirs of the Busquet i Duran family, who had enjoyed it for more than 50 years as a summer house.


    We then remodeled it to transform it into the rural tourism house that it is nowadays.


    **Casa Bernat Project**


    Casa Bernat is a rural accommodation born out of a family project, with the ambition to restore and adapt the original house while keeping the essence of an old house in the Pyrenees.


    One of our priorities has been to turn Casa Bernat into a sustainable and efficient rural house, respecting the environment, the town and the people who live in it.



    **Sustainable house**


    Outer walls of the house have been thermally insulated with rock wool, avoiding petroleum derivatives.


    Wood and stone predominate throughout the house.


    Heating and domestic hot water are powered by renewable energy, with wood chips coming from Pallars.


    Customer electric vehicles can be charged on site.
