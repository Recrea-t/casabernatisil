    Guests will enjoy a 20% discount on activities offered by
    [SnowCanyonPallars](http://www.snowcanyonpallars.com/), Núria’s and Jaume’s
    venture of sports activities. They offer ski lessons, snowshoeing routes,
    canyoning, trekking, via ferrata and guide services at Valls d’Àneu.


    Isil and Pallars Sobirà offer a wealth of activities for all audiences, from sports to leisure, culture and gastronomy.


    In winter, snow is king. If you like skiing, there are slopes in Baqueira-Beret (17min to the car park of La Peülla), Espot-Esquí, Port-Ainé and Tavascan. If you are looking for cross-country skiing, there is Tavascan, Virós-Vall Ferrera and Pla de Beret. The region also offers the opportunity to do different routes with snow rackets. And the options for ski mountaineering routes are endless.


    In spring, more moderate weather suggests taking the bike, whether it is the road or the mountain bike. Àneu and Pallars Valleys offer spectacular itineraries. This is also a great moment in the year to start engaging in water activities as exciting as canyoning or rafting.


    In summer, besides the spring activities, Valls d'Àneu hosts cultural festivals Esbaiola't, Dansàneu, Esterri d'Àneu Beer Fair, Festival of Ancient Music of the Pyrenees, descents of fallas in Isil, Valencia d'Àneu and Alós, festivals every weekend and several fairs among others.


    And in autumn, it is an incredible time to go hiking, go gathering mushrooms or listen to the deer’s roar and contemplate the beautiful natural spectacle of the forest and its colors.


    For more activities and events in the region, Núria and Jaume are at your disposal to inform you about the latest. You can also stay up to date by browsing the [Tourism of the Valls d'Àneu](https://www.turismevallsdaneu.com) website.
